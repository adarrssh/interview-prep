// The garbage collector is an automatic memory management feature of many programming languages, including JavaScript,
//  that helps to reclaim memory that is no longer in use by the program. It does this by identifying and freeing memory 
// that was allocated to objects or variables that are no longer accessible or needed, thereby preventing memory leaks and optimizing the use of available memory.
